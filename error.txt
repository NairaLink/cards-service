I'm trying to parse a json file to the create_card endpoint but
I keep getting errors
look at the error message:
sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: (MySQLdb.IntegrityError) (1364, "Field 'id' doesn't have a default value")
[SQL: INSERT INTO cards (name_on_card, card_brand, card_currency, pin) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)]
[parameters: ('Chizaram', 'VISA', 'NGN', 2100)]
(Background on this error at: https://sqlalche.me/e/14/gkpj)
127.0.0.1 - - [13/Mar/2023 11:53:37] "POST /cards HTTP/1.1" 500 -

you can take a look at the code I wrote, i even reversed to MySQL to see if that was the problem

Here is the format to send the json file as part of the request
curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:3000/cards -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"card_brand": "VISA", "card_currency": "NGN", "name_on_card": "Chizaram", "pin": 2100}' -vvv

Here is the Flask Error I'm getting
Note: Unnecessary use of -X or --request, POST is already inferred.
